            <p>I help people better understand themselves, take a fresh look at how they build their lives,
                solve existing problems and understand the reasons for their occurrence.
                In my work, I consider it important not only to solve specific problems and get rid of symptoms,
                but also to improve the quality of life in general and self-understanding.
                This makes a person more resistant to life's difficulties and is a prevention of the
                recurrence of crises.</p></div>
       
        <div class="box c"><p>In simple words, the resource state is the presence of physical and
            mental strength in a person to solve the upcoming tasks.</p>
</div>
        <div class="box d"></div>
        <div class="box e"><p>Resource state - a certain reserve of energy that allows you to do everything
            quickly and efficiently, while remaining in a good mood.</p>

        <div class="box f"></div>
        <div class="box g"><p>In recent years, more and more people are beginning to take care of their psychological
            health and listen to themselves. Meditations, various trainings and psychological
            practices are becoming popular.</p></div>
